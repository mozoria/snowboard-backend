The backend app was made with ruby on rails, and holds all of the information
that is being communicated to the front end server. The two are not connected
and merely communicate data to one another. The API is what is running in the
background not shown to the user.

Unsolved problems or things I would like to add would be a many to many relationshi
where the snowboards have multiple styles so the user can have multiple snowboards that also have multiple styles

The planning started out with determining what resource i wanted to use and the relationship the user was going to have. Decided to have the resource be a snowboard and have the user own many snowboards
