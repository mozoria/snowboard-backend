The backend app was made with ruby on rails, and holds all of the information
that is being communicated to the front end server. The two are not connected
and merely communicate data to one another. The API is what is running in the
background not shown to the user.

The frontend app is used to display the information actually being communicated
from the API hosted on heroku. You can select what information you would like to
see as well update, delete, and create information you would like to see.

Unsolved problems would include the layout, and how the website is designed.
Would like to simplify it more so its easier to navigate while enhancing how
it looks.

The planning started out with writing user stories, just determining on what I
wanted the website to be able to do. After developing user stories moved onto
drawing the wire frames to see how it would look and what each page would ideally
look like when a button was clicked. After that it was creating an ERD to display
the relationship between a user and a resource. Problem solving went along with
console logging a lot to make sure what I thought a function or action was doing
what I actually wanted, then tracing it back to the line the error occurred.
Using the internet to determine new methods of creating an outcome. Asking others
for help / opinion on how something was done and to see if there was a better more
efficient way to handle issues.
